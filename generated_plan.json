  "query": "Question: Here is a representation of a Roman inscription, originally found on a tombstone. Provide a translation for the Palmyrene script. A transliteration of the text is provided: RGYN\u1d53 BT \u1e24RY BR \u1d9cT\u1d53 \u1e24BL",
  "planning_rationale": "The user's query is a factual knowledge question requiring the translation of a Palmyrene script transliteration. The plan is designed to first gather general linguistic resources for Palmyrene and then specifically search for the meaning of the provided transliteration. These initial search steps can run in parallel. Subsequently, an analysis phase will interpret the gathered information to break down and translate the components of the script. Finally, a synthesis step will formulate the complete translation. This approach ensures comprehensive information gathering, systematic analysis, and a clear final output. Tool selection is limited to WebSearchTools as this is a non-financial, historical/linguistic query.",
