  "planning_rationale": "The user requested a complex DAG that utilizes every tool and agent functionality. I've devised a novel query: 'Analyze the potential impact of recent AI advancements (specifically large language models and generative AI) on the stock performance and future outlook of NVIDIA over the next 1-2 years. Include historical financial data, recent news sentiment, analyst opinions, and a speculative future projection. Finally, summarize the findings and save them to a markdown file.' This query naturally leads to a multi-stage, multi-tool, and multi-agent plan.\n\nThe DAG is structured to maximize parallelism in the initial data gathering phase, with four independent search tasks. These tasks leverage both `YFinanceTools` for structured financial data and `WebSearchTools` for diverse web content (news, analyst reports). Intermediate `THINK` tasks then process and analyze this raw data, leading to a `DEEP` synthesis task. A crucial `AGENT_TEAM` is introduced for the `project_future_outlook` task, recognizing its inherent complexity and speculative nature, requiring collaborative input from a `data_researcher` and an `analyst`. Finally, an `AGGREGATE` task compiles the report, and an `ACT` task uses `FileEditor` to save the output. This plan ensures all available tools (`YFinanceTools`, `WebSearchTools`, `FileEditor`) and agent `task_type` profiles (`SEARCH`, `THINK`, `AGGREGATE`, `ACT`), along with varying `complexity`, `output_format`, and `reasoning_style` combinations, are thoroughly tested.",
