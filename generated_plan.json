  "planning_rationale": "The query is a specific factual knowledge question within philosophy, requiring a deep understanding of two distinct concepts: 'Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem' and 'critical-level views.' The plan first parallelizes the search for detailed information on both concepts to maximize efficiency. Once the necessary information is gathered, a 'THINK' agent will perform a thorough, analytical comparison to identify the specific condition of the theorem that critical-level views violate. Finally, an 'AGGREGATE' agent will select the correct answer from the provided choices and justify it based on the analysis. This approach ensures comprehensive data retrieval, rigorous analysis, and a precise final answer.",
