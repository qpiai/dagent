This plan will illustrate how a query can be approached by setting up a basic structure to distinguish possible interpretations or outputs. We'll create two hypothetical subtasks: one for collecting raw data via a search and another for compiling a simple report from collected data. The approach is intentionally generalized to align with the vague nature of the query.",
